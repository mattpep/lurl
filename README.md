# lurl
little url app

There are lots of public URL shortners. This is my own.

# Functionality

This app has no mechanism (from the web) to add URLs. This is intentional, as
it prevents the need to write a login or authentication system.

# Configuration

This is run as a resident nodejs app.

The key is specified as the URL segment immediately after the nodename. No queerystring parameters are used.
